* Emacs shorcuts and packages

** Shorcuts

*** Commands

1. C-g : Quit from the current command insertion.

*** Cua-mode

See https://ergoemacs.github.io/minor-modes.html.

1. C-v : Paste text.
2. C-xu :
Cut the  selected text. It  is only available  when some text is  selected (traditionally or  with a
rectangle).
3. C-c : Copy the selected text. It is only available when some text is selected (traditionally or with a rectangle).
4. C-z : Undo the last action. Recall that there is no redo command in emacs. The operations applied to the code are saved in a stack. Undo is just another operation and hence it can be undone by itself. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3527142/how-do-you-redo-changes-after-undo-with-emacs.
5. C-return : Starts a rectangle for selecting text. In a rectangle, return changes the cursor to the next vertex of the rectangle.

*** Editor

1. C-x C-c : Exits emacs.
2. f10 : Enters to global menu.
3. C-x C-+ : Increases the text size.
4. C-x C-- : Decreases the text size.

*** Cursor

1. C-x C-t : Transposes the current line with the line above it.

*** File edition

**** Cua-mode
**** Others

1. C-y : Paste.
2. C-w : Cut.
3. M-w : Copy.

*** Buffers / files

1. C-x C-f : Creates a new file.
2. C-x b : Shows the current opened buffers list.
3. C-x C-b : Shows the current opened buffers list in a new buffer. 
4. C-x <left> or C-x <right> : Changes the current buffer.
5. C-x C-s : Saves the current buffer.
6. C-x s : Saves the buffers with changes.
7. C-x 2 : Divides the current windows in two horizontal subwindows.
8. C-x 3 : Divides the current windows in two vertical subwindows3.
9. C-x 1 : Removes every windows division and leaves only one windows with the

3. M-arrow : Moves the current itemize/enumerate/section in the arrow's direction.
4. C-c C-x C-l on a math formula : Renderizes the math formula. The formula must
   be written between \[\] or \(\) for inline formulas. Example: I have studied
   the values \((\log(\Phi_n))^{(k)}(1)\). Furthermore, I like the following
   Taylor series

\[\sum_{j = 0}^\infty \binom{m+j-1}{j} x^{jb} = \frac{1}{(1-x^b)^m}.\]



\[\frac{x^2 + 1}{x}\]

5. C-c C-c on a renderized math formula : Returns to the formula's code. 

6. Export to pdf: http://orgmode.org/guide/LaTeX-and-PDF-export.html.

*** Keyboard macros
Keyboard macros allows us to save a actions sequence. Afterwards, this sequence can be
applied whenever we want. Whenever you press f3 Emacs will start to save the
actions sequence. The key f4 allows you to finish the sequence. Also by pressing
f4 the saved sequence is applied.


** Packages

*** auctex

It provides tex support in emacs. You can install it with the command C-x 

*** dired
You can load dired by using M-x dired. It is a more complex version of C-x
C-f. You can select files with d and delete the selected files by
pushing x.
*** magit
Git integration in Emacs. Pending to be studied and installed.
*** solarized-theme

Solarized theme for emacs. There are two versions:
1. solarized-dark : Blue version of the theme. It is too dark for my screen during the day. I am using it during the night.
2. solarized-light : The first light theme that I enjoy. I am a big fan of Cobalt themes and this theme reminds me to a light version of them.

To change the current theme simply use M-x load-theme <theme name>.
